# AnimatedListView-react-native

In this study, it is presented to the user how the real-life wallet card selection event can be realized in a mobile application. With this study, when the user clicks on any of the views in the interface, the clicked view scrolls upwards on the screen. Other views appear at a lower position than their original position. In this way, it is as if the clicked card has been pulled out of the way. 3 pieces of the view scrolling up are listed horizontally side by side. Then, when you click anywhere, the view that slides up scrolls down and comes back to its original place. 
The component created in this study is named "AnimatedListView". This component takes a parameter named "renderItem". This parameter consists of views that the user wants to list.
